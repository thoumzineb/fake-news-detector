# fake-news-detector
This projectâ€™s aim is to realize a system to detect the fake tweets about Covid-19. The system is developed using a multilayer perceptron propagation neural network. After cleaning data phase, we have built different models. And based on the accuracy we have chosen a model that we used implement the interface.
